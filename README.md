# pharmaverse4devs
Useful Utility Functions and Development Tools for Packages Across pharmaverse!

## Purpose

This package offers developers a transformative solution for streamlining their development processes. By consolidating time-saving utility Addins for use across the pharmaverse ecosystem in one accessible location. It enables developers to prioritize innovation over repetitive tasks.  

## Installation

The package is only available from Github and can be installed with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pharmaverse/pharmaverse4devs")
```

## Scope
The vision is to have a dedicated package for developer Addins and perhaps other dev utility functions that could be used across pharmaverse packages and projects. {pharmaverse4devs} currently has two Addins: `Initiate Pharamverse Blog` is for creating blogs posts for the pharmaverse blog and `Format test_that test file` for numbering tests in testthat files.
